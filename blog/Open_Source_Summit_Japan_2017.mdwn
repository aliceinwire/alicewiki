_Open Source Summit Japan 2017 summary_
  
OSS Japan 2017 was a really great experience.  
  
I sended my paper proposal and waited for a replay, some week after I got a
invite to partecipate at the Kernel Keynote.  
I thought partecipating at the Kernel Keynote was a good way to talk about 
Gentoo Kernel Project and how to contribute in the Linux Kernel and Gentoo
Kernel Project.  
Also my paper got accepted so I could join OSS Japan 2017 as speaker.  
It was three really nice days.

Fast Releasing and Testing of Gentoo Kernel Packages and Future Plans of the Gentoo Kernel Project

My talk was manly about the Gentoo Kernel related Projects past and future  
specifically about the Gentoo Kernel Continuos Integreting system we are creating:  
https://github.com/gentoo/Gentoo_kernelCI
   
Why is needed:  

 * We need some way for checking the linux-patches commits automatically, can also check pre-commit by pushing to a sandbox branch
 * Check the patches signatures
 * Checking the ebuild committed to https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/commits/master/sys-kernel
 * Checking the kernel eclass commits
 * Checking the pull request to the sys-kernel/\*
