Open Source Summit Japan 2017 summary

OSS Japan 2017 was a really great experience.

I sended my paper proposal and waited for a replay, some week after I got a
invite to partecipate at the Kernel Keynote.
I thought partecipating at the Kernel Keynote was a good way to talk about 
Gentoo Kernel Project and how to contribute in the Linux Kernel and Gentoo
Kernel Project.
Also my paper got accepted so I could join OSS Japan 2017 as speaker.

It was three really nice days.
