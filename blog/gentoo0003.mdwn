[[!meta title="Monthly Gentoo bug statistics - 26 October 2013"]]
  
This Month was so much busy... as usual...  
  
This time took me so much time thinking about what to write here i don't know  
why.  
  
Anyway I'm making [Pyherd](https://github.com/aliceinwire/pyherd) a simple  
project for retrive herd and maintainer e-mail from xml metadata, is not  
finished yet, but my intent is to make it work with  
[pybugz](https://github.com/williamh/pybugz) for managing the bugzilla Gentoo  
bugz directly from command line and make the Bug-wranglers job more easy.  
  
I tried to use python-for-android for compile a dictionary  
[midori](https://github.com/blagarde/midori), it tooks so many time to make  
[python for androidi](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android) work because  
of some incompatibility with recent android-ndk version but it worked using  
ANDROIDAPI=14 and export ANDROIDNDKVER=r8e  
[issue](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/issues/159).  so i contribute  
adding [pyparsing-recipe](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/pull/160)  
needed for make the dictionary work. Someone on irc also told be to use  
--orientation=sensor in the build.py usage for use the mobile phone orientation  
sensor, really helpfull.  
  
I also get interested in [Virgil](https://code.google.com/p/virgil/) and started  
to write some code but I need more pratice, so nothing interesting for now.  
  
I was also present at [Open Source Conference fall  
2013](http://www.ospn.jp/osc2013-fall/) #osc13tk with Gentoo booth and i had lot  
of fun! thanks to everyone!!!  sorry if i was not always at the booth.  I gived

to join Gentoo and why](https://github.com/aliceinwire/JoinGentoo)  please if 
you think that something is not correct or imprecise send a pull request!  i'm 
working also at the japanese translation.  
  
I posted some git ebuild patch:  
[BUG-487902](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=487902) and a freebsd  
ebuild patch: [BUG 482512](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482512) about
