___Google Summer of Code day 20___

`What was my plan for today?`  

* Testing elivepatch
* Cleaning code

`What i did today?`  

* commented some code part
* First draft of UserID working

elivepatch server will generate a UUID for a client connection,
and it will assign the UUID for each client.
The livepatch and configs files will be generated in differents
folders for each client request and returned using the UUID.
As now is just a draft but for how I could test it looks 
working.


`what i will do next time?`  
* Cleaning code
* testing it
* Go on with programming and starting implementing the CVE
