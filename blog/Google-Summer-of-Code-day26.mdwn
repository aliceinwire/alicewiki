___Google Summer of Code day 26___

`What was my plan for today?`  

* testing and improving elivepatch

`What i did today?`  

After discussion with mentor.
I need:
* Availability and replicability of downloading kernel sources. [needed]
* Represent same kernel sources as the client kernel source (use flags for now and in the future user added patches) [needed]
* Support multiple request at the same time. [needed]
* Modularity for adding VM machine or container support. (in the future)

Create overlay for keeping old gentoo-sources ebuild where we will keep retrocompatibility
for old kernels:
https://github.com/aliceinwire/gentoo-sources_overlay

Made function for download and get old kernel sources and install sources 
under the designated temporary folder.


`what i will do next time?`  

* Going on improving elivepatch
