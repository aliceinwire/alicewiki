Recently i became Gentoo Kernel Project member, maintaining the Gentoo Kernel branch 4.7  
[[Kernel Project|https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Kernel]]  
  
I already made some release.  
[[gentoo-sources-4.7.6.ebuild|https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-kernel/message/c2646a903ef1d5db819ebac0b4351d99]]  
  
so you can ping me,  
if the Gentoo Kernel is not up to date :)  
  
Recently we had the Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195) kernel vulnerability come out,  
and the Gentoo 4.7 branch update was released after just some couple hours after the kernel patch was release.
