_Open Source Summit Japan 2017 summary_
  
OSS Japan 2017 was a really great experience.  
  
I sended my paper proposal and waited for a replay, some week after I got a  
invite to partecipate at the Kernel Keynote.  
I thought partecipating at the Kernel Keynote as mentor and doing a presentation  
was a good way to talk about Gentoo Kernel Project and how to contribute in the  
Linux Kernel and Gentoo Kernel Project.  
Also my paper got accepted so I could join OSS Japan 2017 as speaker.  
It was three really nice days.

Fast Releasing and Testing of Gentoo Kernel Packages and Future Plans of the Gentoo Kernel Project  

My talk was manly about the Gentoo Kernel related Projects past and future  
specifically about the Gentoo Kernel Continuos Integreting system we are creating:  
[https://github.com/gentoo/Gentoo_kernelCI](https://github.com/gentoo/Gentoo_kernelCI)  
   
Why is needed:  

 * We need some way for checking the linux-patches commits automatically, can also check pre-commit by pushing to a sandbox branch
 * Check the patches signatures
 * Checking the ebuild committed to https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/commits/master/sys-kernel
 * Checking the kernel eclass commits
 * Checking the pull request to the sys-kernel/\*
 * Use Qemu for testing kernel vmlinux correct execution

The keynote was with:  
Greg Kroah-Hartman - Fellow, Linux Foundation  
Steven Rostedt - VMware  
Dan Williams - Intel Open Source Technology Center  
Alice Ferrazzi - Gentoo Kernel Project Leader, Gentoo  

One interesting part was about how to contribute to the Linux Kernel.  
After some information about Linux Kernel contribution numbers the talk moved on  
ho to contribute in the Linux Kernel.  
For contribute in the Linux Kernel there is need of some understanding of C  
and running test in the Linux Kernel.  
Like fuego, kselftest, coccinelle, and many others.  
And also a good talk from Steven Rostedt about working with Real-Time patch.
