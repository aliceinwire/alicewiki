Updated my Wget alias command for download attachments file from bugzilla with login, now I added --content-disposition:
- first make the cookies file
#wget --save-cookies wget-cookies.txt --cookies=on --output-document=logindetails.html http://bugzilla_site/bugzilla/index.cgi?Bugzilla_login=username@email.com\&Bugzilla_password=password\&GoAheadAnd
- then in .bashrc or .zshrc:
#alias wgetDL='wget --load-cookies ~/bin/wget-cookies.txt --content-disposition'

       --content-disposition
           If this is set to on, experimental (not fully-functional) support for "Content-Disposition" headers is enabled. This can currently
           result in extra round-trips to the server for a "HEAD" request, and is known to suffer from a few bugs, which is why it is not
           currently enabled by default.

           This option is useful for some file-downloading CGI programs that use "Content-Disposition" headers to describe what the name of a
           downloaded file should be.

Reported Fix upstream for:
[Bug 450742](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=450742) - (CVE-2012-6086) net-analyzer/zabbix: Improper use of cURL API might lead to improper SSL certificate verification (MiTM) (CVE-2012-6086)

From zabbix.com report [ZBX-5924](https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-5924) in 2.0.8 this problem is been fixed in 1.8.18rc1, 2.0.8rc1, 2.1.2
so now i can use more uptdated Curl because the old one had some problem on work with Freebsd

Yesterday i got [editing priviledge](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=483008) on Gentoo Bugzilla for helping in [The Gentoo Bug Wranglers Project](https://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/bug-wranglers/index.xml), Thanks to TomWij for advocating and mentoring :)

Made zabbix ebuild for 2.0.8 and posted on [BUG-482810](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482810) i removed the curl restriction and updated to EAPI=5, tested on freebsd and looks working.

Checked about making ebuild for bhyve and Vramsteg
Vramsteg have no package so i think to make a 9999 ebuild for get it directly for git in the meantime

I also requested to be added in the [larrythecow.org](http://larrythecow.org) planet [FL-698](http://bugs.funtoo.org/browse/FL-698)

I'm requesting a booth space at the OSC Tokyo Fall 2013 for Gentoo-jp community, so if you pass by, please say Hello :)

And I'm intesifying my Japanese study so my gentoo activity will be a bit slow...
