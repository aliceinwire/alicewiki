[[!meta title="Vegetable Curried Zucchini Soup"]]
I made this Curried Zucchini Soup, thanks Christine Spang for the link of the recipe.  
i used 4 cups vegetable broth instead of the 4 cups chicken broth in the recipe and it was really nice,  
i love the apple and zucchini flavor in the soup, the curry is essential!
