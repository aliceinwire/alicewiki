[Don't commit generated files](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/version-control.html)  
Today I started from css, at first we introduced it with the generated files, but now that we are using vagrant for developing such files are not needed and dosen't have to be maintained under a revision system as best practice.  
instead the vagrantfile now is containing a simple    
  
[[!format  bash """
echo -e "\n--- Updating css ---\n"  
gem install compass  
cd /vagrant/webd  
compass compile  
"""]]  
  
After finishing to autocreate the css file i moved to make the init service.  
At first like I said in the previous post i thought to use supervisor, but i got into a problem, supervisor is requiring to specify the enviroment variable,
and celery+ansible was claming about such call. giving a "muxserver_listen bind(): Operation not permitted" error.  
  
so i used instead LSB-init and all started to work.  
you can see all the file [here](https://github.com/eisen-dev/eisen_engine/tree/master/init)   
  
Because of this, I'm starting to make actual releasing box using  
  vagrant package --output eisen.box  
  
And if I'm not too late happy pi day #piday  from eisen
