in this days i had some server problem with the iscsi  
http://paste.debian.net/166259/  
  
lucky after the reboot the error was gone  
  
i had updated nautilus-actions at 3.2.2 on debian with the upload of my sponsor Christine  
  
but for the most im studing for my ccna exam that i had set at 20 june at 12:00  
  
after that i hope to have time for work on Python,more Debian packets,Django,perl and open source networking  
  
im also using mosh http://mosh.mit.edu/ made by keithw  
is really fast and stable, i love it !  
and i can work on my server also with my slooow mobile connection
