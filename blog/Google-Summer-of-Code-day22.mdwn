___Google Summer of Code day 20___

`What was my plan for today?`  

* Testing elivepatch
* work on making elivepatch support multiple calls

`What i did today?`  

* working on sending the kernel version
* working on dividing users by UserID

At first connection because the UserID is not present will be
created and returned by the elivepatch server.
The client will store the UserID in shelve so that it can
authenticate next time is inquiring the server.
By using python UUID I'm assigning different UUID for each user.

By using this we can start supporting multiple calls.

`what i will do next time?`
