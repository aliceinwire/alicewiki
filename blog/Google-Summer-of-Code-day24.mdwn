___Google Summer of Code day 24___

`What was my plan for today?`  

* Cleaning code
* testing it
* Go on with programming and starting implementing the CVE

`What i did today?`  

* Working with getting the linux kernel version from configuration file
* Working with parsing CVE repository

I could implement to get the linux kernel version from the configuration file,
and I'm working on parsing the CVE repository.
Would also be a nice idea to work with the kpatch scripts for making it Gentoo
compatible.
But I also got into one problem, that is we need to find a way to download
old gentoo-sources ebuild for building old kernel, 
where in the server there isn't the needed version of kernel sources.
This depend from how much back compatibility we want to give.
And with old gentoo-sources we cannot assure that is working.
Because old gentoo-sources was using different versions of gentoo repository, 
eclass.
So is a problem to discuss in the next days.

`what i will do next time?`  

* work on the CVE repository
* testing it
