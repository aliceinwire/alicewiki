All my hacking friends are using ikiwiki since some year ago, so after some trouble with my old server host (aruba) and after buying my rps from ovh.it i started playing with ikiwiki + gitolite and gitweb.

Gitolite is really funny to use and ikiwiki is really simple clear and versatile.
At the same time im working and also studing for some certification im gonna taking like ccna (im not so happy about ccna because there is lot of cisco copyrighted stuff but is for sure a good basis for a depp knowledge for routing protocol) but i hope really soon to be more into python and perl programming!!!

After some problem with rps as i told in the last post, i made ikiwiki and gitolite work together on the server (i installed also irssi and znc), but it was leaking the blogging part of ikiwiki, today i made work also this blog :D.
In the future i'm customizing it more.

So bye bye old blog!
Welcome Ikiwiki
