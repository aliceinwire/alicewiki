___Google Summer of Code day 33___

`What was my plan for today?`  

* testing and improving elivepatch

`What i did today?`  

* lpatch added locally
* fix ebuild directory
* Static patch and config filename on send
    This is useful for isolating the api requests using only the uuid as
    session identifier
* Removed livepatchStatus and lpatch class configurations.
    Because we need a request to only be identified by is own UUID,
    for isolating the transaction.
* return in case the request with same uuid is already present.

we still have problem about 
"can'\''t find special struct alt_instr size."

I will investigate it tomorrow



`what i will do next time?`  

* testing and improving elivepatch
* Investigating the missing informations in the livepatch
