[Open Source Conference 2016 Tokyo](http://www.ospn.jp/osc2016-fall/)  
    
Many people came to the Gentoo booth,  
mainly students and Open Source users  
asking for Gentoo information.  
  
We gave away around **200 flyers**, and  
many many stickers during the two days.

Unfortunately the sticker we ordered  
from unixsticker had some SVG problem.

We had also in exposition some esoteric  
enviroment like the [IS01 sharp](http://www.pulster.de/info/sharp/is01/sharp-is01-faq.htm),   
off course mounting Gentoo as Native and   
as prefix.   
Of course one of the first things we tried  
was the 5 minutes long Gentoo sl command.

We also had a Gentoo notebook  
running wayland (the one in the middle).

It was an amazing event and I would   
like to thanks everyone that came to  
the Gentoo booth, everyone that helped  
making the Gentoo booth and all the  
amazing Gentoo community.
