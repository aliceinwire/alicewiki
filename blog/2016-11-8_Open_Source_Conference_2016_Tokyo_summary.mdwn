[Open Source Conference 2016 Tokyo](http://www.ospn.jp/osc2016-fall/)  
    
Many people came to the Gentoo booth,  
mainly students and Open Source users  
asking for Gentoo information.  
  
We could give away around **200 flyer** in two  
days, and many many stickers.

We had also in exposition some esoteric  
enviroment like the [IS01 sharp](http://www.pulster.de/info/sharp/is01/sharp-is01-faq.htm),   
off course mounting Gentoo as Native and   
as prefix.   
Of course one of the first things we tried  
was the 5 minutes long Gentoo sl command.

We see a SailfishOS and I discovered  
that [SailfishOS porting](https://fureidofort.blogspot.jp/2013/12/nemo-apps-on-sailfishos-emulator.html)  cannot use  
android application.
