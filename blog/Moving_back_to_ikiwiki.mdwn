I was trying to use [blogs.gentoo.org/alicef/](http://blogs.gentoo.org/alicef/) Gentoo official blog  
based on wordpress.   
As far as I could like the draft feature, it had some big drawback.  
Most big one I couldn't post any syntax highlighted code.   
And wordpress maintenance takes lots of time, in particular managing plugins.

So I decided to come back to ikiwiki, also in ikiwiki I can make some sort of draft function where post tagged as draft dosen't come up on the blog list.   
This is simply done by using this on the blog.mdwn  
pages="page(blog/*) and !*/Discussion and !*/local.css and !tagged(draft)"  
That will remove the blog page tagged with draft from the blog view.  
  
For the syntax highlight I used a plugin for pygments.py made by  
 [tylercipriani.com](http://tylercipriani.com)  
That you can find here [pygments.pm](https://github.com/thcipriani/dotfiles/blob/deef49f1b6a65d1d45071eade67c1f396eb70efd/ikiwiki/IkiWiki/Plugin/pygments.pm)  

Like this:
[[!pygments c content="""
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	// your code goes here
	return 0;
}
"""]]

And last one, on Ikiwiki comments, I decided to delegate comments spam to disqus, also if I don't like so much to use a private business plugin, do is job of managing comments well enough.  
I also just discovered that disqus is part of Y combinator, the company behind hacker news.  


[[!tag draft ]]
