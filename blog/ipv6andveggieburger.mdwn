[[!meta title="Ipv6 and Veggie Burger"]]

Im living in Tokyo, Itabashi-Ku now!  
Is happen all so fast that i hadn\`t realized already... it sounds so strange think, that i did to come here...  
Unfortuatly not all is good and i had failed my CCNA with a point of 815/825 for pass, less than a answer...  
But i will retry it next month here.  
I had also update my website for the World Ipv6 day (6 june), so now you can find it with ipv6 at [ipv6.aliceinwire.net](http://ipv6.aliceinwire.net)   
  
Last week i found that at J.S. Burgers Cafe chains in Tokyo they make a nice Veggie Burger for 900ï¿¥  
  
I don\`t know the recipe but is really teasty and also the fry potatoes are so good.
