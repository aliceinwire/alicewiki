___Google Summer of Code summary week 03___


What I did in this week 03 summary:

elivepatch:

 * Created the elivepatch client command line argument parser
 * Added function for sending patch and configuration files
 * Divided the call for sending (patch, config) and the call for building the livepatch
 * made send_file function more generic for sending all kind of files using RESTful api
 * Cleaned code following pep8
 * Decided to use only SSL and to don't use basic auth
 * Sending informations about the kernel version when requesting a livepatch build
 * We can now build livepatch using the RESTful API
 * Returning information about the livepatch building status


Kpatch:

 * Working on making kpatch-build working also with gentoo with all the features (As now kpatch-build can only automatically build livepatch for Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, Fedora)


Others:

 * Ask infra for a server for install the elivepatch server


What I need to do next time:

 * Finish the function for download the livepatch to the client
 * Testing elivepatch
 * Implementing the CVE patch uploader
 * Installing elivepatch to the Gentoo server
 * Fix kpatch-build for automatically work with gentoo-sources
 * Add more features to elivepatch
