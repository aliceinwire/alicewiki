                    Gentoo also need something similar.

                    Design repository:  
                        - Github  
                            - project management

            Slide: my chaotic /etc/portage  
                - package.use can become chaotic  
                - /var/lib/portage/world difficult to remeber when you added something and why  
                - let's use package.use directory and put file name about what you are installing  
                - not what but why you installed the package  
            Presenter: alicef  
            Slide: How to contribute on Gentoo Github  
                - recently Gentoo CVS repository as been converted to Git  
                - Using the Github mirror is possible to send pull request.  
                - Good point of pull request:  
                    - Code comment and review from more than one developer  
                    - fast way to send ebuild patch upstream  
                    - QA automatic check   
                - Bad point of pull request:  
                    - the review are open to see to everyone  
                    - basic git knowledge is needed  
                When we clone Gentoo repository:   
                    Use git clone --depth=50   
                    for fast pull request with less log information  
                    git clone and git clone --depth=50 time difference:

            Presenter: @usaturn  
            Slide: systemd-nspawn & btrfs  
                - On Gentoo using systemd-nspawn  
                btrfs:   
                    - copy on write  
                    - using subvolume we can make snapshot  
                    - compress is possible  
                    - cannot make swapfile  
                Systemd:   
                    - unit is the process file manager  
                    - using systemd stage 3 is simple to install  
                    - not using syslog but journald  
                    - network setting by networkd  
                    - instead of cron there is timer  
                    - instead of ntp there is systemd-timesyncd  
                    - grub is not needed, instead systemd-boot (ex gummi boot) work as bootloader  
                    - docker is not needed, instead systemd-nspawn using machinectl command (good for testing gentoo package)

            Slide: automatically resolving conflict   
                Gentoo developer, btrfs, linux kernel, emacs, T-code  
                portage:  
                    resolving conflict  
                        - when USE flag is needed it will ask to add a USE flag.  
                        - when circulation dependency is detected it will ask to remove a USE flag, for example  
                    Why there is a conflict:  
                        - Before installing a new package, we have a package (for example perl-5.20) with all the the   dependency package setted  
                        - when we are goin to update world and we get a new package update (for example perl-5.22), also some dependency of perl-5.22 get new update  
                        - in this situation can happen that some dependency linked to perl-5.20 get in conflict with   perl-5.22  
                    How can we fix such situation:  
                        we have a option to add --reinstall-atoms="Y" to emerge command (Y= name of the dependency package   that is causing problem)  
                        this command will instead of just update the package it will reinstall the package as if they are not   installed, solving such dependency problem.  
                    Why package is anyway deciding to automatically not fixing dependency  
                        maybe because trying to fix all the dependecy will not work correctly  
                    When portage have conflict for many package  
                        it became more complicated and we will have a command similar to this:  
                        --reinstall-atoms="A B C D E F G H I L M N ..."  
                    For solving such problem there is emerge --reinstall-atoms wrapper  
                        https://github.com/naota/emerge-wrapper  
                        - automatically fixing circle dependecy  
                        - showing dependency graph  
                        - there is also a function for make try the dependency graph in a container  
                        - emerge analyzer tool
