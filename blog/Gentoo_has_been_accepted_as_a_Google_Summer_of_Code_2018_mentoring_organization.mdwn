___Gentoo has been accepted as a Google Summer of Code 2018 mentoring organization___

Gentoo has been accepted into the Google Summer of Code 2018!
  
Mentors:
If you want to mentor some projects on Gentoo GSoC 2018 please add
yourself here [1] as soon as possible, is important!.
Someone from the Gentoo GSoC team will contact you back, as soon as possible.
  
Students:
If you are a student and want to spend your summer on Gentoo projects
and having fun writing code, you can start discussing ideas in the #gentoo-soc IRC Freenode channel [2].  
You can find some ideas example here [3], but of course could be also
something different.  
Just remember that we strongly recommend that you work with a
potential mentor to develop your idea before proposing it formally.
Don’t waste any time because there’s typically some polishing which
needs to occur before the deadline (March 28th)
  
I can assure you that Gentoo GSoC is really fun and a great experience
for improving yourself.
It is also useful for making yourself known in the Gentoo community.
Contributing to the Gentoo GSoC will be contributing to Gentoo, a
bleeding edge distribution, considered by many to be for experts and
with near-unlimited adaptability.

If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to
contact us [4] or check the Gentoo GSoC 2018 wiki page [5].
